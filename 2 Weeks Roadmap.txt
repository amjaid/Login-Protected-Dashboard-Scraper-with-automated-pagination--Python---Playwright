8-WEEK ROADMAP TO $1000+/MONTH
===============================

GOAL: Move from demo projects → first clients → $1000+/month steady income on Upwork.

---------------------------------------------------
WEEK 1: Practice & Polish (Preparation Week)
---------------------------------------------------
Objectives:
- Finish all 3 demo projects:
  1. OrangeHRM login dashboard scraper
  2. Public dynamic e-commerce scraper
  3. Advanced multi-URL scalable scraper
- Ensure all projects have:
  - README.md with overview & ethical notice

Job applications: NONE this week (practice & confidence building)
Outcome: Full portfolio ready for Upwork

---------------------------------------------------
WEEK 2: Start Applying (Small Jobs)
---------------------------------------------------
Objectives:
- Apply to **5–10 small scraping/automation jobs per day**
- Target jobs:
  - Public data scraping (JS content)
  - Login-protected dashboards
  - Table / product data extraction
- Focus on small fixed-price jobs ($50–$150)
- Reference demo projects in proposals:
  - Login dashboard: “I have built login-protected dashboard scrapers”
  - E-commerce scraper: “I can scrape dynamic JS-heavy sites and export structured data”
  - Multi-URL scraper: “I can handle pagination, retries, and multi-page scraping”

Outcome:
- 1–3 jobs won by the end of the week
- Gain first reviews

---------------------------------------------------
WEEK 3: Complete First Jobs & Collect Reviews

- Communicate proactively:
  - Confirm login details
  - Confirm data fields required
  - Confirm output format
- Ask for feedback/review after delivery
- Apply to slightly higher-budget jobs ($100–$200)

Outcome:
- 3–5 positive reviews
- Confidence with client communication

---------------------------------------------------
WEEK 4: Increase Job Complexity & Rates
---------------------------------------------------
Objectives:

  - Login dashboards with multiple tables
  - Combination tasks (scrape + automate reports)
- Apply to jobs $150–$300
- Reference your 3 demos in proposals
- Optional: Offer minor value-adds (retry logic, clean logging)

Outcome:
- 1–2 medium projects in progress
- Rate increase justified by reviews

---------------------------------------------------
WEEK 5: Deliver Medium Projects & Upskill
---------------------------------------------------
Objectives:
- Deliver medium projects **error-free**
- Upskill slightly:
  - Handling site-specific quirks
  - More advanced Playwright waits
  - Data cleaning (remove duplicates, standardize formatting)
- Apply to 5–8 jobs/day
- Start negotiating slightly higher fixed-price projects

Outcome:
- $500–$700/month income
- 2–3 medium reviews

---------------------------------------------------
WEEK 6: Build Repeat Clients
---------------------------------------------------
Objectives:
- Offer repeatable services to satisfied clients

Outcome:
- $700–$900/month
- Stronger portfolio with real client examples

---------------------------------------------------
WEEK 7: Optimize Workflow & Expand
---------------------------------------------------
Objectives:
- Deliver multiple projects concurrently (if manageable)
- Optimize code for faster delivery
- Optional: Introduce advanced features for clients:
  - Resume scraping after failure
  - Config-driven scraper
- Apply for slightly higher budgets
- Maintain 5–10 proposals/day

Outcome:
- $900–$1000/month achievable

- Fully confident in web scraping & automation services

---------------------------------------------------
NOTES:
- Daily time commitment: 2–4 hours first 2 weeks, 3–5 hours later
- Always communicate professionally
- Never promise bypassing security / CAPTCHA
- Focus on **delivery + reliability** over perfection in code
- Use GitHub repos as proof of skills in every proposal

---------------------------------------------------
PROPOSAL STRATEGY:
- Always reference a relevant demo project
- Ask clarifying questions
- Offer small improvements (retry, logging, clean CSV)
- Start with lower rates, increase after 3–5 good reviews
