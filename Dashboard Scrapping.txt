# Login-Protected Dashboard Scraper (Python + Playwright)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates automated **login, navigation, and data extraction** from a **JavaScript-rendered, login-protected dashboard** using **Python and Playwright**.

The scraper simulates a real-world internal business system where users must authenticate, navigate menus, handle paginated tables, and export structured data.

A **public demo website** is used strictly for educational and demonstration purposes.

## 🌐 Target Website (Public Demo)

**Website:**  
https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/

**Demo Credentials (publicly provided):**
- Username: `Admin`
- Password: `admin123`

### Why this website is ideal
- Requires authentication
- Real dashboard UI
- Multiple internal pages
- Dynamic JavaScript content
- Paginated tables
- Business-style data

This closely mirrors real client systems such as CRMs, admin panels, and internal dashboards.

## 🎯 Data Extraction Objectives

### Option A: Employee List (Primary Demo)

**Navigation Path:**  
`PIM → Employee List`

**Data Fields Scraped:**
- Employee ID  
- First Name  
- Last Name  
- Job Title  
- Employment Status (if visible)

**Why this is valuable**
- Looks like real business data
- Clean tabular structure
- Pagination handling required
- Very common client request

---

### Option B: User Management Table (Alternative Demo)

**Navigation Path:**  
`Admin → User Management → Users`

**Data Fields Scraped:**
- Username  
- User Role  
- Employee Name  
- Status  

This scenario represents typical **internal system audits and reporting automation**.

---

## 🧠 Automation Flow (Client-Expected Logic)

The demo clearly demonstrates the following workflow:

1. Open the login page  
2. Enter credentials securely  
3. Wait for dashboard to fully load  
4. Navigate using menu interactions  
5. Locate dynamic data tables  
6. Extract structured data  
7. Handle pagination  
8. Export clean output files  

Only **10–30 rows** are extracted for demonstration purposes.

---

## 📦 Output Format

The extracted data is exported as:

- `employees.csv`
- `employees.xlsx`

### Output Characteristics
- Clean column headers
- No raw HTML
- Ready for business use (reporting, analysis)

---

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- Python 3.x  
- Playwright (Chromium)  
- Pandas

## ⚠️ Ethical & Legal Notice

> This project uses a **publicly available demo website** provided for testing and educational purposes only.

- No private or personal data is accessed
- No CAPTCHA or security mechanisms are bypassed
- No scraping of real SaaS platforms is performed

This reflects professional and ethical scraping practices.

---

## ❌ What This Demo Does NOT Do

To maintain professional standards, this project **does not**:

- Scrape real private SaaS tools (Stripe, Jira, Notion, etc.)
- Bypass CAPTCHAs or security systems
- Access personal or sensitive data
- Claim to scrape “any website without limits”

---

## 🧪 Alternative Demo Websites (Optional)

These can be used for secondary demonstrations:

### 1️⃣ The Internet (Herokuapp)
https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/

- Login automation
- Navigation handling
- Simple authentication flows

### 2️⃣ Demo TestFire (Altoro Mutual)
http://demo.testfire.net/

- Login flows
- Account dashboards
- Table-based data

---

## 🏆 Why This Demo Attracts Clients

When clients review this project, they see:

- Login handling
- Dashboard navigation
- Dynamic content scraping
- Pagination logic
- Structured data export

This directly translates to:
> “This developer can automate and scrape our internal system.”

That is exactly what most Upwork scraping clients want.
