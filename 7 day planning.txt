AGGRESSIVE BUT PROFESSIONAL PROPOSAL TEMPLATES
===============================

Template 1: Login/Protected Sites

Hi [Client Name],

I specialize in Python web scraping and automation using Playwright. I can build a solution to extract your data from login-protected dashboards, navigate menus, handle dynamic content, and export structured CSV/Excel files.

I’ve built similar projects:
- Login-based dashboard scraper (demo: [GitHub link])
- Dynamic e-commerce scraper (demo: [GitHub link])

My approach ensures:
- Pagination handling
- Retry logic for reliability
- Clean, ready-to-use output

Could you clarify if the dashboard requires 2FA or CAPTCHA?

Looking forward to helping you automate this task efficiently.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
